# Company Logos

To add company logos to your timeline:

1. **Add logo files** to this directory with these names:
   - `optiver-logo.jpg` - Optiver logo
   - `snowflake-logo.png` - Snowflake logo
   - `ibm-logo.png` - IBM logo

2. **Recommended specs**:
   - Format: PNG (transparent background preferred)
   - Size: 48x48px or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - File size: Under 50KB each

3. **Fallback behavior**:
   - If logos are missing, placeholder initials/icons will show
   - Optiver: "OPT"
   - Snowflake: ❄️ emoji
   - IBM: "IBM"

The logos will automatically appear once you add the files to this directory.
